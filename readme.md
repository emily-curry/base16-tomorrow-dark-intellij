# Base16 Tomorrow Dark

A port of my own [VSCode theme](https://github.com/emily-curry/base16-tomorrow-dark-vscode) styled to look like
Atom's [base16-tomorrow-dark-theme](https://github.com/atom/base16-tomorrow-dark-theme), with some minor modifications
and italics thrown in for flair. Workbench colors taken from Atom's One Dark UI theme.
